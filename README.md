# assembly

This repo will hold my assembly adventure, I will decide on a small project to make later when I understand how to do things.

First things first, this will not be a challenge as the Chip-8 project, it will not be time limited, I intend on keeping constant commits, which may be slowed down when college break ends (I will start my second year of graduation this year), but I hope to be able to make some time for this until I actually make a small project that satisfies me.
